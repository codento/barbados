There exist many Clubs.

A Club has:
  - name: string
  - members: many Members
  - harbours: many Harbours
  And various other stuff like address we probably don't care about for this
  demo.

A Member has:
  - first name: string
  - last name: string
  - street_address: string
  - postcode: string (with constraints?)
  - city: string
  - country: string
  - phone_number: string (with constraints?)
  - email: string (with constraints?)
  - birth date: Date
  - joining date: Date
  - boats: many Boats
  Let's make only first name, last name, email and joining_date mandatory.

A Harbour has:
  - name: string
  - jetties: many Jetties
  And various other stuff like address we probably don't care about for this
  demo.

A Jetty has:
  - name: string (e.g. a letter, 'D')
  - berths: many Berths
  We may also need attributes for e.g. number of sides (1 or 2) and numbering
  scheme (e.g. odd one side, even the other), if we do a graphical view.

A Berth has:
  - name: string (e.g. 'D10')
  - boat: zero or one Boats
  And perhaps we'll need a type, e.g. small/large, let's not worry about that
  initially.

A Boat has:
  - name: string
  - type: enum: sailboat or motorboat
  - model: string (e.g. 'Maxi 999')
  - manufacturer: string
  - manufacturing country: string
  - registration_number: string (unique; with constraints?)(e.g. 'A12345')
  - sail number: integer (optional, e.g. 1234)
  - boat certificate number: int (e.g. 1503)
  - length: int (in centimetres, e.g. 990, display as metres)
  - beam: int (i.e. width in centimetres, display as metres)
  - height: int (i.e. mast height, in centimetres, e.g. 1490, display as metres)
  - draught: int (i.e. keel depth, in centimetres, e.g. 170, display as metres)
  - weight: int (in kilograms, e.g. 4200, display as tonnes (1 tonne = 1000kg))
  - material: enum: fibreglass, wood, metal or other
  - colour: string (e.g. 'white')
  - inspection class: int (1=offshore, 2=coastal, 3=archipelago)
  - inspection year: int
  - hull inspection year: int
  - insurance company: string (e.g. Pohjola)
  That's enough to start with. Let's make no fields mandatory.
