User:
  - Club: xRxx
  - Harbour: xRxx
  - Jetty: xRxx
  - Berth: xRxx
  - User: xRUx    (can only read own details; can update own address etc., but not name, joining date or birth date (affects pricing, cheaper for juniors))
  - Boat: xRxx    (can read only own boat's details, can't modify as some details like length affect pricing)

Note that a user will sometimes have more than one role, and they should have the union of those roles' rights. For instance (obvious case), the Harbourmaster can modify his own boat's details.
