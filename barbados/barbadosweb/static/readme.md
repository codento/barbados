NOTE

All files under /stati should rather be in its own folder, that in development mode is public and in production not. But for now all client files are simply under /static.


DEVELOPMENT

npm install -g jspm
jspm install
start django server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html
(can also be loaded straight from filesystem)
